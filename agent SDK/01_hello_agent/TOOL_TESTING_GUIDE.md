## **🎯 Expected Results**

### **✅ Working Tools:**

- **Weather**: Should return actual weather data (demo or real)
- **News**: Should return formatted news headlines (demo data)
- **Time**: Should return current date and time
- **Math**: Should calculate and return results
- **Random**: Should generate random numbers in specified range
- **Password**: Should generate secure passwords
- **Text Analysis**: Should count words, characters, sentences
- **Unit Conversion**: Should convert between units

### **🔧 Enhanced Tools:**

- **Search**: Now uses OpenAI's knowledge base for comprehensive answers
- **Currency**: Uses real exchange rate API

## **🐛 Debugging**

If a tool doesn't work:

1. Check the terminal output for debug messages
2. Look for "Tool output found in response" vs "Tool output NOT in response"
3. Verify the tool is being called (ToolCallItem appears)
4. Check if the fallback system switches to OpenAI

## **📊 Success Indicators**

You should see in terminal:

```
Debug - Forcing [tool_name] tool usage for query: [your query]
Debug - Tool output: [actual tool result]
Debug - Tool output found in response
```

And in the UI, the agent should provide the actual tool output, not generic responses.

## **🚀 Advanced Test Cases**

### **Complex Queries:**

```
What's the weather in London and also give me the current time?
Search for universities in Germany and convert 50 EUR to USD
Generate a random password and tell me what time it is
Calculate 25*4 and also show me today's news
```

### **Edge Cases:**

```
Weather in a misspelled city: "Londn"
Math with complex expression: "((25+15)*2)/4"
Very long text analysis: [paste a paragraph]
Currency conversion with unusual pairs: "THB to ISK"
```

Copy these queries and test them one by one to verify all tools are working correctly! 🎉
