## Handoffs in OpenAI Agent SDK

### ‚úÖ What Are Handoffs?

- **Definition**: Handoffs allow one agent to delegate tasks to another agent, enabling modular workflows.
- **Use Case**: Ideal for scenarios where different agents specialize in distinct areas, such as billing, technical support, or refunds.
- **Analogy**: Similar to transferring a customer to the appropriate department in a call center.

### üõ†Ô∏è How to Implement Handoffs

#### 1. Define Specialized Agents

To create specialized agents, you define them with specific instructions.

```python
from agents import Agent

# Specialized agents
billing_agent = Agent(name="Billing Agent", instructions="Handle billing inquiries.")
refund_agent = Agent(name="Refund Agent", instructions="Process refund requests.")
```
````

#### 2. Create a Triage Agent with Handoffs

Next, you create a triage agent that can delegate tasks to the specialized agents based on the user's inquiry.

```python
triage_agent = Agent(
    name="Triage Agent",
    instructions=(
        "Assist the user with their questions. "
        "If they ask about billing, handoff to the Billing Agent. "
        "If they ask about refunds, handoff to the Refund Agent."
    ),
    handoffs=[billing_agent, refund_agent],
)
```

#### 3. Run the Triage Agent

Now, you can run the triage agent with a sample query to test the handoff functionality.

```python
from agents import Runner

# Run the triage agent
result = await Runner.run(triage_agent, "I need help with my bill.")
```

#### 4. Optional: Customize Handoffs

You can further customize how the handoffs work by overriding tool names, descriptions, filtering inputs, or adding custom callbacks.

```python
from agents import handoff

def custom_on_handoff(ctx):
    print("Custom handoff logic executed.")

custom_handoff = handoff(
    agent=billing_agent,
    tool_name_override="custom_billing_tool",
    tool_description_override="Custom billing tool description",
    on_handoff=custom_on_handoff,
)
```
